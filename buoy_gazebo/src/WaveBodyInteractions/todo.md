At this point the wave-body interaction plugin is functional, and there are tests that compute an indpendent solution for special cases of heave-only, and pitch-only.  Because that independent solution isn't a full 6DOF solver, some compromises have been made in the testing.  In particular, the pitch-only case compares to the full 6DOF Gazebo simulation.  This requires that the COM is moved to the water-plane level so that the example buoy rotates around the center of floatation.  Also, the tests is a decay test from a small initial pitch angle.  In the full 6DOF case computed by Gazebo, this imparts a small surge force/motion when it starts.  Because the hydrodynamics include a surge/pitch coupling, this causes an extraneous pitch moment that causes the solution to not match the pure 1DOF independent solver.  When this surge induced pitch is forced to be excluded, the results match to machine-precision.

Things to consider/do
-  Create a full 6DOF single-body solver to enable a test that compares the Gazebo solution of arbitrary motions and incoming waves to.
- Improve the FreeSurfaceHydrodynamics library to use a 'pose' input instead of the more specfic 321 Euler angles as a specification of the input orientation.  Not cleare what library to represent the pose is best...
- The plugin requires the use of .1/.3 WAMIT files for the hydrodynamic coefficients.  This is fine, but there are more general solutions available that would make this more compatible with other boundary element methods
- Because of the intended purpose, this plugin and the FreeSurfaceHydrodynamics library is specific to axi-symmetric bodies.  Genearal bodies would be a practical extension.
