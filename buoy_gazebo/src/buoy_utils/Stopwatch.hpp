/// sim time if use_sim_time set in node). Keeps track of time spent in the run state, accessed
/// through ElapsedRunTime(), and time spent in the stop state, accessed through ElapsedStopTime().
/// Elapsed run time starts accumulating after the first call to Start(). Elapsed stop time starts
/// accumulation after Start() has been called followed by Stop(). The stopwatch can be reset with
/// the Reset() function.
